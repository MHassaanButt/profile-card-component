## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
<!-- - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles -->

### What I learned

I learned the most important thing during solving challenge is that SASS is more usable and flexible to use instead of simple CSS. We can define varibles and functions I can maintain a proper hierarchy for our peoject. Flexbox makes work easy to design mobile layout and I suggest we always hav to go first for mobile design and then look for dekstop design.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This helped me for understanding flexbox and it's different properites. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
